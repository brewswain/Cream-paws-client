# Cream-paws-client

Welcome to my WIP Stock management's client Repo! 

#### Test pages and flows are present, so any weird code placement will be blamed by that. There's also some Typing that needs to get fixed/improved, will be done once I'm happy with overall app functionality.

The functionality it aims for is pretty simple:
- Allow user to create Customers, Stock products (for now, dog chow), and Orders.
- View Outstanding Expenses powed to supplier
- Overall finance tracking
